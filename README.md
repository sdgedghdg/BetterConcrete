# BetterConcrete
A minecraft datapack which makes concrete more convenient and better.

## What can it do?
- Turn the concrete powder into the colored glasses with furnace
- Make concrete powder with sand or gravel(both of them or only use one) eg: `3x Sand and 5x Gravel` or `8x Sand`
- Recolor the concrete (powder) with dye and any concrete(or powder) eg:`1x Pink Dye and 5x Lime Concrete and 2x Black concrete and 1x Pink Concrete`
- Turn concrete powder into concrete with water bucket or ice. eg:`1x *Ice/Water Bucket* and 8x Yellow Concrete Powder`
